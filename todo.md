1. ~~first start slow and create a basic program of reading from one file~~
2. ~~then write the contents you read from that file to another file.~~
3. ~~try to clean up the stuff you wrote so far like by putting inside a class~~
   1. ~~so that we can implement the mvc model in it~~

feedback:

1. method segregation
   1. the main will basically have hardly one or two lines of code and it will
      not do anything.
   2. It will just call the class and let the class handle all the stuff,
      basically the class will act like a blackbox, using the full potential of
      abstraction.
   3. Inside the class, it can do multiple things and handle things on its own,
      but dont let the user manipulate with your data.
2. Naming can be better.
3. for loops can be avoided if gone with the approach of transform stream.
